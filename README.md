# FORB-SLAM

# This is an improvement of [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2/ "T")
ORB-SLAM is one of the most sucessful mono-SLAM. But there is some drawbacks of this kind of SLAM.
Here I improve ORB-SLAM and get a higher accuracy than before.

Later on, I will publish my thesis on a conference or on Arivx.

My result will show on KITTI board.
